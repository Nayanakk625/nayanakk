Wireshark Traffic Analysis Report

Capture Summary:
- Total Packets: 3,066
- Capture Size: 1,186,650 bytes
- Capture Overview: The data includes traffic using IPv6, IPv4, TCP, UDP, and several application-layer protocols like DNS and HTTP.

Protocol Breakdown:
1. Ethernet (100%):
   - All captured packets fall under Ethernet, representing the data link layer.

2. Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) (66.3%):
   - Packets: 2,032
   - Data Volume: 81,280 bytes
   - Observations: A significant portion of the traffic uses IPv6, reflecting modern network usage.

3. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) (33.7%):
   - Packets: 1,032
   - Data Volume: 20,640 bytes
   - Observations: Legacy IPv4 traffic is also present.

Transport Layer Protocols:
1. User Datagram Protocol (UDP):
   - IPv6 UDP: 31.4% of packets (964 packets).
   - IPv4 UDP: 6% of packets (183 packets).
   - Observations: UDP traffic is primarily used for DNS queries and other lightweight protocols.

2. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):
   - IPv6 TCP: 34.6% of packets (1,062 packets).
   - IPv4 TCP: 27.4% of packets (841 packets).
   - Observations: TCP traffic includes secure protocols like HTTPS and HTTP.

Application Layer Protocols:
1. DNS (Domain Name System):
   - IPv6 DNS: 0.5% (14 packets).
   - IPv4 DNS: 5.3% (161 packets).
   - Observations: DNS traffic indicates frequent domain name resolution, possibly from web browsing.

2. HTTP and HTTPS:
   - HTTP: 0.1% (4 packets).
   - HTTPS (over TLS): 12.9% (394 packets).
   - Observations: HTTPS dominates, showing a trend toward secure web communication.

3. Other Protocols:
   - ICMP (Ping): Minimal traffic (<0.3%).
   - QUIC IETF: 30.7% of packets (942 packets), likely used for fast, secure communications such as Google services.

Key Insights:
1. Protocol Usage:
   - IPv6 is more prevalent than IPv4, reflecting modern network adoption.
   - Secure protocols like HTTPS and QUIC dominate the traffic.

2. DNS Activity:
   - DNS queries indicate active domain name resolution, likely from web browsing or applications.

3. Low HTTP Traffic:
   - Minimal unencrypted HTTP traffic suggests a secure network environment.

Observations:
- The captured data shows a balanced usage of IPv4 and IPv6, with IPv6 being slightly more prominent.
- Secure protocols such as HTTPS and QUIC make up a significant part of the traffic, indicating a focus on secure communication.
- The presence of DNS traffic aligns with active browsing and application usage.
- Minimal unencrypted HTTP traffic suggests the network has a strong emphasis on secure communications.
