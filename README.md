# üîê Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator

## üß† Overview

This project is a Python-based tool that allows users to:
- Analyze the strength of passwords using the `zxcvbn` library.
- Generate custom wordlists based on user-provided personal information.
- Export wordlists in `.txt` format for use in security testing tools.
- Interact through both Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a GUI (Tkinter).

## üöÄ Features

- Password strength analysis using entropy and pattern detection.
- Custom wordlist generation using names, years, pet names, etc.
- Includes leetspeak and common password mutation patterns.
- GUI interface built with Tkinter.
- Exports `.txt` files for penetration testing purposes.
