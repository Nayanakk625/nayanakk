### **Open Ports and Services**
| **Port**  | **State** | **Service**       | **Description**                            |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 135/tcp   | open      | msrpc             | Microsoft RPC, typically used for remote management. |
| 139/tcp   | open      | netbios-ssn       | NetBIOS Session Service. Common on older Windows systems. |
| 445/tcp   | open      | microsoft-ds      | SMB protocol, used for file sharing and printer sharing. |
| 1521/tcp  | open      | oracle            | Oracle database listener.                  |
| 1935/tcp  | open      | rtmp              | Real-Time Messaging Protocol, often for streaming. |

### **Host Script Results**
1. **`smb-vuln-ms10-061`**: Could not negotiate a connection.  
   - Likely due to SMB configuration or patching.

2. **`samba-vuln-cve-2012-1182`**: Could not negotiate a connection.  
   - Similar to above, may indicate the service is patched or unavailable.

3. **`smb-vuln-ms10-054`**: Returned as `false`.  
   - This confirms the system is not vulnerable to the MS10-054 exploit.

### **Analysis**
#### **Critical Issues:**
1. **Open SMB Ports (139 and 445)**:  
   - **Risk**: Vulnerable to exploitation if SMBv1 is enabled.  
   - **Action**: Disable SMBv1 and enforce SMBv2 or SMBv3.

2. **Oracle Listener (Port 1521)**:  
   - **Risk**: May expose sensitive database functionality.  
   - **Action**: Restrict access to trusted IPs and enforce strong authentication.

#### **High Issues:**
1. **NetBIOS (Port 139)**:  
   - **Risk**: Commonly targeted for information gathering and exploitation.  
   - **Action**: Disable NetBIOS if not required.

2. **PostgreSQL (Port 5432)**:  
   - **Risk**: Open database ports could lead to unauthorized access.  
   - **Action**: Configure strong authentication and restrict access.

3. **Streaming Services (Ports 1935 and 7070)**:  
   - **Risk**: May be unnecessary and increase attack surface.  
   - **Action**: Disable if not needed.

#### **Medium Issues:**
1. **Unknown Port (49152)**:  
   - **Risk**: May indicate an application with an open dynamic port.  
   - **Action**: Investigate and close if unnecessary.

2. **Outdated Software Configurations**:  
   - **Risk**: Potential vulnerabilities due to old service versions.  
   - **Action**: Update all running services to the latest versions.

---

### **Recommendations**
1. **Secure SMB**:
   - Disable SMBv1 and enforce SMBv2 or SMBv3.
   - Use a firewall to block Ports 139 and 445 from external networks.

2. **Harden Databases**:
   - Apply patches to Oracle and PostgreSQL.
   - Restrict access using IP filtering and strong credentials.

3. **Disable Unnecessary Services**:
   - Turn off streaming protocols (RTMP, RealServer) if not required.

4. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep the OS and all services updated to the latest versions.

5. **Perform Follow-Up Scans**:
   - Use a tool like Nessus Essentials or OpenVAS for detailed analysis.

### **Next Steps**
1. Address critical and high-severity vulnerabilities immediately.
2. Re-scan the system after implementing fixes to verify mitigation.
3. Document all changes and maintain a secure configuration baseline.
